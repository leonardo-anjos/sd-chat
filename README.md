Client/Server chat app using Java sockets and threads

### Client
To communicate with the server, the client uses one single socket whichâ€™s an 
object from Socket class, to send and receive data from server

run Client in other computer. Set the IP host on `Client.java`

```java
  clientSocket = new Socket("IP_HOST", 5000);
```

### Server 
To communicate with client, the server uses two types of sockets

- ServerSocket : this class is used by the server to declare a ServerSocket 
object which the server needs to listen to connection requests from the clients

- Socket : this class is used by the server to declare a Socket object, which 
the server uses to send and receive data from the client
